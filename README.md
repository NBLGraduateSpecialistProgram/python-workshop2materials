# python-workshop2materials
Materials for Python Workshop 2 (Data Manipulation and Analysis with Python), created for Data Services at the Rutgers-New Brunswick Libraries.

Please download the files in this repository to a directory you can access through Jupyter Notebook. We will be using the "Wkshp2_Part1_DataManipAnalysis.ipynb" and "loadarray.txt" files in the first half of the workshop, and the "Wkshp2_Part2_DataManipAnalysis.ipynb" and UN_refugee_data files in the second half. The other .ipynb files are provided for your reference, as they contain solutions to exercises described in the workshop files.

The CSV files in the UN_refugee_data folder contain data from the UNHCR and can be found at http://popstats.unhcr.org under the Persons of Concern, Resettlement, and Demographics tabs, respectively. Data was exported following selection of appropriate checkboxes corresponding to the maximum amount of data output (e.g. "All Years" under the "Years" drop-down menu).
